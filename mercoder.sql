Your flight just landed at the airport nearest to your destination, and you now need to rent a car to finish your journey. At the car rental kiosk, you are informed that they only rent ‚ÄúSmart Self-Driving Cars.‚Äù Being the techy person that you are, you are very excited about riding in this very special car. The rental agent then informs you that their smart cars have an unusual software glitch. When you enter your destination in the smart car, it calculates the shortest distance, and begins driving. The unusual part is that the car continuously adjusts its speed to always be ‚Äúan hour away‚Äù from your destination. That is, when you are 100 miles away, the car travels 100 mph; when you are 97.5 miles away the car travels 97.5 mph; when you are 1 mile away the car travels 1 mph. Being the great technical problem solver that you are, you realize at this rate, you will never get to your destination!  You also know that you can stop the car at any point and walk.  You, therefore, must determine when to stop the car and start walking in order to get to your amazing vacation the fastest.\r\n', '4\r\n100 3\r\n50 3\r\n8 5\r\n1000 1', '4.51\r\n3.81\r\n1.47\r\n7.91\r\n', 'Your input will begin with a single line containing the number of vacation test cases 1 <= n <= 20000.

We want to write a computer program which will calculate the total leap years in an inclusive range of years.

Here is the rule.\r\nEvery year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

A set of dishes from the list are picked such that the sum of all votes for those dishes is equal to or greater than the chosen threshold.\r\nCooking all those dishes is a lot of work, and your family is under a lot of pressure to decide the menu and get it prepared by the big day. You despise cooking, so you offer a bargain: given the list of dishes, the total votes for each, and how long each dish takes to prepare, you‚Äôll figure out a set of dishes that can be prepared in the least amount of time and still meet or exceed the vote threshold.
